# heyy,  
welcome welcome

my name is Hugo, i'm a 26yo data engineer working on building scalable data solutions at Sonae, Portugal's largest retail company. my academic background combines a bachelor's in mathematics and a master's in computer science with my thesis being focused on Machine Learning and handling imbalanced data, where I'm currently developing and working on a new DBSCAN improved version to deal with small disjuncts. 

i'm particularly into apache spark and large-scale data pipelines. lately, i've been diving into ml, and, as a huge nerd & board game enthusiast, i'm currently building a board game recommendation system. you can read more about it on my [blog post](https://wilowsballoc.bearblog.dev/boardom-buster-my-boardgame-recommendation-system/).
